    m_Localized: "While navigating the shadowy paths of the Forbidden Thicket, you
      stumble upon a resting adventurer by a dim lantern. Coren looks up, his gaze
      weary but alert.\n\n\"These woods take more than they give,\" he says gruffly.
      \"I have something of value... but I'll not part with it lightly. A bit of
      your strength, and it\u2019s yours. Or perhaps you'd prefer to walk away."
